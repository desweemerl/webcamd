The code and patches under the "media_tree" and the "patches"
directory are covered by the GPLv2 license. See "media_tree/COPYING"
for more information. The rest of the code is covered by the 2-clause
BSD license or as noted in the source and header files. Sometimes
helper functions are copied from the Linux-kernel and these will
remain GPLv2 licensed even though mixed with 2-clause BSD licensed
code. If in doubt about the copying rules send an e-mail to
hselasky@freebsd.org to get any issues clarified. Webcamd can ship
sources for some binary only drivers available for Linux. Before
making hardware clones using drivers available from this distribution
I recommend asking the driver authors if it is fine to avoid any post
flame-wars in the linux media e-mailing lists due to some driver
writers having various business interests in the hardware supported by
their drivers.

Thank you for reading! Hope you enjoy using webcamd on your computer!
